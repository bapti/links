#### Lean enterprise

#### Deep work

Cal Newport (ComSci professor as Georgetown University) says that Deep Work is becoming an increasingly rare skill. In order to deliver on any really complex problems you need to get yourself able to do decent chunks of deep work. I would say it's pretty similar to getting into the state of flow but in a more focused manor on what you're working on.

**Rhythmic deep work**

For the same period of time each day perform deep work.  For instance I could make sure I don't take meetings in the morning to give myself 10-12 dedicated to delivering value.  

**Rules for doing deep work**

Form a set of habits before embarking on doing deep work. These habits make it easier to keep focus on what you're trying to achieve while also reducing the will power required.

- Ban on email, internet and phone
- Plan the work before doing it to minimise willpower usage
- Pick a location to do deep work
- The pomodoro technique will work well here to visualise distractions and keep you focused on the task at hand

**4 disciplines of execution**

It's easy to have great strategy and ideas but much harder to deliver on them.  4DX is a framwork to help you execute on your plans.

- Set a wildly import goal
- Act on lead measures (behaviours that will contribute to the goal)
- Keep score of the lead measures
- Review regularly and hold yourself to account

**Leave work at work**

With building goals and focus it's just as important to have true down time. This lets your conscious mind rest but also gives your unconscious mind a crack at the problems you're facing.

- Build a ritual for the end of the day
 - Check email/calendar one last time then close it
 - Check slack one last time then close it
 - Make a plan for the next day - top 3 or 5 things to do
 - Make sure trello board is in sync
 - Repeat your mantra - mine is "All done for the night"
 - If you think about work outside of work have faith in your system and repeat "All done for the nigh"
 
**Productive meditation**

This is practice of identifying a difficult problem that you're facing then going for a walk and thinking about the problem.  Try to come at it from multiple angles in your mind.

**Practice concentrating**

Cal says that doing mental exercises like memorising a deck of cards will help train your mind to concentrate without getting distracted.

Another exercise would be to try to complete a technical problem within a set time period. This forces a focused mind in order to deliver within the time period.  The primes problem is a good example of this.  Trying to deliver in 2 hours, then decrease the time with each practice.

**Tool adoption**

Only adopt a new tool if it contributes toward one of your goals and the positive impact far outweighs the negative impact

**Schedule the day**

At the beginning of every day create a paper schedule dictating what you want to work on at what time in any particular day. This could be blocks for email, code, 1-2-1s, meetings, reading etc.  This should help with the batching of work into shallow and deep. It also visualises what you're spending your time and might give you clues to maximising your time.

**80/20 rule**

20% of the work you do delivers 80% of the value.  Try to figure out what that 20% is and maximise that kind of work.
 


#### Mindset: How you can fulfil your potential

Dr Carol Dweck asserts that there are two mindsets - fixed and growth.  Essentially having a fixed mindset can limit our potential to be everything that we want to be.  Below is a very high level bullet point summary of what I got from the book to remind me in the future if I want to come back and remind myself of the points that were pertinent to me.

**Fixed Mindset**

Leads to a desire to look smart and therefore a tendancy to
- avoid change
- get defensive
- give up easily
- ignore useful feedback
- feel threatened by the success of others

**Growth Mindset**

Leads to a desire to learn and therefore a tendancy to
- embrace challenges
- persist in the face of setbacks
- see effort at the path to mastery
- learn from criticism
- find lessons and inspiration in the success of others
 
**What is the growth mindset?** 

- You can always substantially change how intelligent you are
- You can always change basic things about what kind of person you are
- Always be open to criticism and change

**Questions to ask every day to maintain a growth mindset**

- What did I learn today
- What mistake did I make that taught me something
- What did I try my hardest at today
