#### Mindset - How you can fulfil your potential

Dr Carol Dweck asserts that there are two mindsets - fixed and growth.  Essentially having a fixed mindset can limit our potential to be everything that we want to be.  Below is a very high level bullet point summary of what I got from the book to remind me in the future if I want to come back and remind myself of the points that were pertinent to me.

**Fixed Mindset**

Leads to a desire to look smart and therefore a tendancy to
- avoid change
- get defensive
- give up easily
- ignore useful feedback
- feel threatened by the success of others

**Growth Mindset**

Leads to a desire to learn and therefore a tendancy to
- embrace challenges
- persist in the face of setbacks
- see effort at the path to mastery
- learn from criticism
- find lessons and inspiration in the success of others
 
**What is the growth mindset?** 

- You can always substantially change how intelligent you are
- You can always change basic things about what kind of person you are
- Always be open to criticism and change

**Questions to ask every day to maintain a growth mindset**

- What did I learn today
- What mistake did I make that taught me something
- What did I try my hardest at today
